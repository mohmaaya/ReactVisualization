# ReactVisualization
Tech Stack: JavaScript namely React, d3 library, CSS<br>
In this minor task, I have used the d3 library of JS to implement the visualization of points. <br>
The points are fetched from the server and then drawn onto the graph using the functionalities provided by the d3 library. <br>
<br>
Each of the points contains data which are then shown once clicked in a generated popup. This functionality is implemented using React Portal.<br>
